# Simple Template matching in C++

This project belongs to the realm of computer vision, is showcased in ["Finding More than Waldo: Template Matching Adventures"](https://blog.salvatorelabs.com/finding-more-than-waldo-template-matching-adventures/). Where we delve into the nuances of template matching, our exploration sheds light on the art of enhancing visual clarity within image processing.

To use the project and experience its magical image processing capabilities, you'll need to install the `lib-turbojpeg` library on your system. This library is essential for handling JPEG image compression and decompression efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide to installing `lib-turbojpeg` using Homebrew:

### Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)

If you don't have Homebrew installed on your macOS system, you can install it by opening your Terminal and executing the following command:

``` /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" ```

### Step 2: Install lib-turbojpeg

Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install `lib-turbojpeg` by running the following command in your Terminal:

```brew install jpeg-turbo```

Homebrew will fetch the necessary files and libraries and install `lib-turbojpeg` on your system.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

To verify that `lib-turbojpeg` is installed correctly in the directory `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jpeg-turbo/2.1.5.1/` if is in another directory modify the `Header Search Paths` and `Library Search Paths` accordingly

### You're Ready to Go!

With `lib-turbojpeg` installed on your system, you can now use the project and explore its magical image processing capabilities to create captivating and dreamy visuals. Have fun experimenting with Gaussian blur and unleashing your creativity to craft mesmerizing masterpieces!
